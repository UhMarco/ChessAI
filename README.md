This is a work in progress, I'll write a proper readme when I've finished or am close to finishing the project.
For the time being you can play against an opponent that makes random moves.
## Known issues:
- After white promoting a pawn, the bot will not make a move.
- If a black pawn reaches the final square then you'll be able to pick what it promotes to.

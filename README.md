This is a prototype for a chess AI I am working on. The purpose of this was to test design choices and get some practice before making a "production" version. The bot makes random moves as no AI will be implemented on this version.

## Known issues:
* After white promoting a pawn, the bot will stop making moves.
* If a black pawn reaches a promotion square then you'll be able to pick what it promotes to.
* King move generation doesn't consider its opponent's king.

## Built with
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* [Pieces from chess.com](https://www.chess.com/)
